### The reason for this return. 

The World of API's

Last week (Time that I am writing it) we had a workshop about API's. Santiago Dononso led the workshop and he is a teacher from KEA (KÃ¸benhavns Erhvervsakademi) and he went in depth about API's both exploring the back-end and in the front-end. We explored the possibilities what an API can do and that it is possible to do it in mutiple coding languages. 

GET


POST

DELETE

PUT

PATCH

I was really cool what he did, I liked it alot.
We went in the backend and saw

Explaining what we did, and why we are returning the same code that Santiago coded with us.

To test the API's we used an application called Postman, where you can copy the link that is suposed to be the API and choose different methods you want to use when testing it, i.e GET, POST, DELETE, PUT and PATCH (methods avaliable when the API is written in js.

However the methods GET and POST are only avaliable in PHP, so the directory (link) has to be changed, so the user knows what he is testing

The files that I will return are the files that I did with Santiago in the workshop, but I will also leave Santiago's files, that he did (also a link to his repo if you want to clone it on the bottom of this document)
